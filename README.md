# IntersubjectiveAgreement
Analysis of Intersubjective Agreement

This is the analysis code and dataset of Intersubjective Agreement (IA).

Raw data available here: https://osf.io/7spxd/

The following major preprocessing code is made by Zhao Hui Koh. https://github.com/zhaokoh/gist-generation-analysis

1, Raw data --> psy4100_master_data.RData

2, Spell check & text mining

3, IA across SOA is calculated by analysis_intersubjectivity_AUC.R

4, ROC figures is made by analysis_intersubjectivity_AUC.Rmd

5, All functions

The following preprocessing and analysis code is made by Chuyin Zhang.

1, psy4100_master_data.RData --> preprocessed.RData (calculating candidate variables)

2, IA for each SOA is calculated by Calculate_IAperSOA.R

3, Results section: Results section.Rmd

4, Comparison between lab and online participants: comparison_lab_online.Rmd
